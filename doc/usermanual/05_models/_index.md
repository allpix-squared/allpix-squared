Allpix Squared implements a variety of properties and models to describe
the physics of semiconductor detectors. Models are implemented
module-independently and can be selected via configuration parameters in
the respective models, while sensor material properties serve as a
default to module parameters and can be overwritten in the respective
configuration section. This chapter serves as central reference for the
different properties and models.
