This Getting Started guide is written with a default installation in mind, meaning that some parts may not apply if a custom
installation was used. When the `allpix` binary is used, this refers to the executable installed in `bin/allpix` in the
installation path. It is worth noting that before running any Allpix Squared simulation, ROOT and (in most cases) Geant4
should be initialized. Refer to [Section 2.4](../02_installation/04_initializing_dependencies.md) for instructions on how to
load these libraries.
