This Getting Started guide is written with a default installation in
mind, meaning that some parts may not apply if a custom installation was
used. When the `allpix` binary is used, this refers to the executable
installed in `bin/allpix` in the installation path. It is worth noting that before
running any Allpix Squared simulation, ROOT and (in most cases) Geant4 should be
initialized. Refer to [Section 2.5](../02_installation/05_initializing_dependencies.md) for instructions
on how to load these libraries.
