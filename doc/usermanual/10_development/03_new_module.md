Owing to its modular structure, the functionality of the Allpix Squared can easily be extended by adding additional modules
which can be placed in the simulation chain. Since the framework serves a wide community, modules should be as generic as
possible, i.e. not only serve the simulation of a single detector prototype but implement the necessary algorithms such that
they are reusable for other applications. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to split up modules to support the modular
design of Allpix Squared.

Before starting the development of a new module, it is essential to carefully read the documentation of the framework module
manager which can be found in [Section 5.3](../04_framework/04_modules.md). The basic steps to implement a new module,
hereafter referred to as `ModuleName`, are the following:

1. Initialization of the code for the new module, using the script `etc/scripts/make_module.sh` in the repository. The
   script will ask for the name of the model and the type (unique or detector-specific). It creates the directory with a
   minimal example to get started together with the rough outline of its documentation in `README.md`.

2. Before starting to implement the actual module, it is recommended to update the introductory documentation in
   `README.md`. No additional documentation has to be provided, as this file is automatically included in the user manual.
   It should be written in GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM) \[[@markdown]\], so that formulae can also be included (see the
   [spec entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#math)). The Doxygen documentation in `<ModuleName>.hpp` should
   also be extended to provide a basic description of the module.

3. Finally, the constructor and `init`, `run` and/or `finalize` methods can be written, depending on the requirements of the
   new module.

Additional sources of documentation which may be useful during the development of a module include:

- The framework documentation in [Chapter 4](../04_framework/_index.md) for an introduction to the different components of
  the framework.

- The module documentation in [Chapter 8](../08_modules/_index.md) for a description of the functionality of other modules
  already implemented, and to look for similar modules which can help during development.

- The Doxygen (core) reference documentation included in the frameworkÂ \[[@ap2-doxygen]\].

- The latest version of the source code of all modules and the Allpix Squared core itself.

Any module potentially useful for other users should be contributed back to the main repository after is has been validated.
It is strongly encouraged to send a merge request through the mechanism provided by the software repository \[[@ap2-repo]\].

## Files of a Module

Every module directory should at minimum contain the following documents (with `ModuleName` replaced by the name of the
module):

- `CMakeLists.txt`:
  The build script to load the dependencies and define the source files of the library.

- `README.md`:
  Full documentation of the module.

- `<ModuleName>Module.hpp`:
  The header file of the module.

- `<ModuleName>Module.cpp`:
  The implementation file of the module.

These files are discussed in more detail below. By default, all modules added to the `src/modules/` directory will be built
automatically by CMake. If a module depends on additional packages which not every user may have installed, one can consider
adding the following line to the top of the module's `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
ALLPIX_ENABLE_DEFAULT(OFF)
```

General guidelines and instructions for implementing new modules are provided in
[Section 10.3](../10_development/03_new_module.md).

### `CMakeLists.txt`

Contains the build description of the module with the following components:

1. On the first line either `ALLPIX_DETECTOR_MODULE(MODULE_NAME)` or `ALLPIX_UNIQUE_MODULE(MODULE_NAME)` depending on the
   type of module defined. The internal name of the module is automatically saved in the variable `${MODULE_NAME}` which
   should be used as an argument to other functions. Another name can be used by overwriting the variable content, but in
   the examples below, `${MODULE_NAME}` is used exclusively and is the preferred method of implementation.

2. The following lines should contain the logic to load possible dependencies of the module (below is an example to load
   Geant4). Only ROOT is automatically included and linked to the module.

3. A line with `ALLPIX_MODULE_SOURCES(${MODULE_NAME} <sources>)` defines the module source files. Here, `sources` should be
   replaced by a list of all source files relevant to this module.

4. Possible lines to include additional directories and to link libraries for dependencies loaded earlier.

5. A line with `ALLPIX_MODULE_REQUIRE_GEANT4_INTERFACE(${MODULE_NAME})` adds the Geant4 interface library as explained in
   [Section 14.1](../14_additional/01_tools.md#geant4-interface).

6. A line to register the directory with module tests, for example `tests` as in
   `{ALLPIX_MODULE_TESTS(${MODULE_NAME} "tests")`.

7. A line containing `ALLPIX_MODULE_INSTALL(${MODULE_NAME})` to set up the required target for the module to be installed
   to.

A simple `CMakeLists.txt` for a module named `Test` which requires Geant4 is provided below as an example.

```cmake
# Define module and save name to MODULE_NAME
# Replace by ALLPIX_DETECTOR_MODULE(MODULE_NAME) to define a detector module
ALLPIX_UNIQUE_MODULE(MODULE_NAME)

# Load Geant4
FIND_PACKAGE(Geant4 REQUIRED)

# Add the sources for this module
ALLPIX_MODULE_SOURCES(${MODULE_NAME}
    TestModule.cpp
)

# Add Geant4 to the include directories
TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MODULE_NAME} SYSTEM PRIVATE ${Geant4_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Allpix Geant4 interface is required for this module
ALLPIX_MODULE_REQUIRE_GEANT4_INTERFACE(${MODULE_NAME})

# Link the Geant4 libraries to the module library
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${MODULE_NAME} ${Geant4_LIBRARIES})

# Register module tests
ALLPIX_MODULE_TESTS(${MODULE_NAME} "tests")

# Provide standard install target
ALLPIX_MODULE_INSTALL(${MODULE_NAME})
```

### `README.md`

The `README.md` serves as the documentation for the module and should be written in GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)
\[[@markdown]\]. It is automatically included in the user manual in [Chapter 8](../08_modules/_index.md).

The `README.md` should follow the structure indicated in the `README.md` file of the `DummyModule` in `src/modules/Dummy`,
and should contain at least the following sections:

- A YAML header with the name of the module (`title`), a short description of the module (`description`) the status
  (`module_status`) and maintainers (`module_maintainers`) of the module.

  If the module is working and well-tested, the status of the module should be `Functional`. By default, new modules are
  given the status `Immature`. The maintainer should mention the full name of the module maintainer, with their email
  address in parentheses. A minimal header is therefore:

  ```yaml
  title: "ModuleName"
  description: "Some short description"
  module_status: "Functional"
  module_maintainers: ["John Doe (<john.doe@example.com>)"]
  ```

  In addition, the input (`module_inputs`) and output (`module_outputs`) objects of the module should be given as well.

- An H2-size section named **Description**, containing a short description of the module.

- An H2-size section named **Parameters**, with all available configuration parameters of the module. The parameters should
  be briefly explained in an itemised list with the name of the parameter set as an inline code block.

- An H2-size section with the title **Usage** which should contain at least one simple example of a valid configuration for
  the module.

For advances features in GLFM such as citations and formulae, see `doc/README.md` in the project repository \[[@ap2-repo]\].

### `<ModuleName>Module.hpp` and `<ModuleName>Module.cpp`

All modules should consist of both a header file and a source file. In the header file, the module is defined together with
all of its methods. Brief Doxygen documentation should be added to explain what each method does. The source file should
provide the implementation of every method and also its more detailed Doxygen documentation. Methods should only be declared
in the header and defined in the source file in order to keep the interface clean.

## Module structure

All modules must inherit from the `Module` base class, which can be found in `src/core/module/Module.hpp`. The module base
class provides two base constructors, a few convenient methods and several methods which the user is required to override.
Each module should provide a constructor using the fixed set of arguments defined by the framework; this particular
constructor is always called during by the module instantiation logic. These arguments for the constructor differ for unique
and detector modules.

For unique modules, the constructor for a `TestModule` should be:

```cpp
TestModule(Configuration& config, Messenger* messenger, GeometryManager* geo_manager)
    : Module(config) {}
```

For detector modules, the first two arguments are the same, but the last argument is a `std::shared_ptr` to the linked
detector. It should always forward this detector to the base class together with the configuration object. Thus, the
constructor of a detector module is:

```cpp
TestModule(Configuration& config, Messenger* messenger, std::shared_ptr<Detector> detector)
    : Module(config, std::move(detector)) {}
```

The pointer to a Messenger can be used to bind variables to either receive or dispatch messages as explained in
[Section 4.6](../04_framework/06_messages.md). The constructor should be used to bind required messages, set configuration
defaults and to throw exceptions in case of failures. Unique modules can access the GeometryManager to fetch all detector
descriptions, while detector modules directly receive a link to their respective detector.

In addition to the constructor, each module can override the following methods:

- `initialize()`:
  Called once per module from the main thread after loading and constructing all modules and before starting the event
  loop. This method can for example be used to initialize histograms.

- `initializeThread()`:
  Called after global initialization but before event processing and gives the possibility to initialize worker
  thread-specific members for modules. If multithreading is used, this method is called by each worker thread separately;
  if the simulation is run single-threaded, it is called once by the main thread.

- `run(Event* event)`:
  Called for every event in the simulation, with a pointer to the current event object as parameter. An exception should be
  thrown for serious errors, otherwise a warning should be logged.

- `finalizeThread()`:
  Called for each worker thread after processing all events in the run. If multithreading is used, this method is called by
  each worker thread separately; if the simulation is run single-threaded, it is called once by the main thread.

- `finalize()`:
  Called once per module from the main thread after processing all events in the run and before destructing the module.
  Typically used to save the output data (like histograms). Any exceptions should be thrown from here instead of the
  destructor.

If necessary, modules can also access the ConfigurationManager directly in order to obtain configuration information from
other module instances or other modules in the framework using the `getConfigManager()` call. This allows to retrieve and
e.g. store the configuration actually used for the simulation alongside the data.

If a module should be run using multithreading but requires to execute its run method in the order of event numbers, for
example a module that writes to an output file, then the module can inherit from the `SequentialModule` class, without
implementing additional functionality. This will ensure that the run method will receive events one-by-one and in the correct
sequence.
