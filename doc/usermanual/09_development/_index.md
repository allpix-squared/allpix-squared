This chapter provides a few brief recipes for developing new simulation
modules and detector models for the Allpix Squared framework. Before
starting the development, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository
\[[@ap2-repo]\] should be consulted for further information on the
development process, code contributions and the preferred coding style
for Allpix Squared.
