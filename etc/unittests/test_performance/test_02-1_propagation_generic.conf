#DESC tests the very critical performance of the drift-diffusion propagation of charge carriers, as this is the most computing-intense module of the framework. Charge carriers are deposited and a propagation with 10 charge carriers per step and a fine spatial and temporal resolution is performed. The simulation comprises 500 events.
