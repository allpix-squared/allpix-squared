#DESC tests the performance of charge carrier deposition in the sensitive sensor volume using Geant4. A stepping length of 1.0 um is chosen, and 10000 events are simulated. The addition of an electric field and the subsequent projection of the charges are necessary since Allpix Squared would otherwise detect that there are no recipients for the deposited charge carriers and skip the deposition entirely.
