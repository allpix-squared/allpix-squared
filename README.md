# Allpix<sup>2</sup>
### Generic Pixel Detector Simulation Framework

Allpix<sup>2</sup> is a generic simulation framework for silicon detectors, written in modern C++. The goal of the Allpix<sup>2</sup> framework is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use package for simulating the performance of silicon detectors from incident ionizing radiation to the digitization of pixel hits in the detector ASIC.

For more details about the project please have a look at the website at https://cern.ch/allpix-squared.

## Dependencies
* [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/building-root) (required, with the GenVector component)
* [Boost.Random](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/boost_random/reference.html) (required, version >= 1.64.0)
* [Geant4](http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/installguide.html) (optional, but required for typical purposes, multithreading capabilities should be enabled)
* [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (optional, but required for typical purposes)


## Usage on machines with CVMFS

Ready-to-run installations of Allpix<sup>2</sup> are provided via the CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS) for use on SLC6 and CentOS7 machines supported by CERN. In order to use Allpix<sup>2</sup>, the respective environment has to be set up by sourcing the appropriate file:

```
$ source /cvmfs/clicdp.cern.ch/software/allpix-squared/<version>/x86_64-<system>-<compiler>-opt/setup.sh
```
where `<version>` should be replaced with the desired Allpix<sup>2</sup> version and `<system>` with the operating system of the executing machine (either `slc6` or `centos7`). The compiler versions available via the `<compiler>` tag depend on the selected operating system.

After this, the `allpix` executable is in the `$PATH` environment variable and can be used.
It should be noted that the CVMFS cache of the executing machine has to be populated with all dependencies when running the program for the first time.
This can lead to a significant start-up time for the first execution, but should not affect further executions with the cache already present.
More information can be found in the [CVMFS documentation](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem).


## Installation
The CMake build system is used for compilation and installation. The install directory can be specified by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>` as argument to the CMake command below. Other configuration options are explained in the manual (see the documentation section below).

The dependencies need to be initialized for the build to succeed. Currently there are two methods to load these:

### Prerequisites on CERN LXPLUS
In order to install Allpix<sup>2</sup> on the CERN LXPLUS batch cluster, a LXPLUS setup script is provided:
```
$ source etc/scripts/setup_lxplus.sh
```
Then, continue as described under the compilation section.

### Prerequisites on a private machine
The dependencies listen above have to be satisfied. Both ROOT6 and Geant4 libraries and headers have to be in the path, this is usually achieved by sourcing the `thisroot.sh` or `geant4.sh` scripts. After this, continue as described below.

### Compilation
To compile and install a default installation of Allpix<sup>2</sup>, run the following commands

```
$ mkdir build && cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make install
```

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the documentation below.


## Documentation
The most recently published version of the User Manual is available [from the website](https://cern.ch/allpix-squared/usermanual/allpix-manual.pdf).
The Doxygen reference is published [online](https://cern.ch/allpix-squared/reference/) too.

The latest PDF version of the User Manual can also be created from source by executing
```
$ make pdf
```
After running the manual is available under `usermanual/allpix-manual.pdf` in the build directory.

To build the HTML version of the latest Doxygen reference, run the following command
```
$ make reference
```
The main page of the reference can then be found at `reference/html/index.html` in the build folder.
