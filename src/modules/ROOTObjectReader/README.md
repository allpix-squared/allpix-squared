## Description
Converts all object data stored in the ROOT data file produced by the ROOTObjectWriter module back in to messages (see the description of ROOTObjectWriter for more information about the format). Reads all trees defined in the data file that contain Allpix objects. Creates a message from the objects in the tree for every event.

If the requested number of events for the run is less than the number of events the data file contains, all additional events in the file are skipped. If more events than available are requested, a warning is displayed and the other events of the run are skipped.

Currently it is not yet possible to exclude objects from being read. In case not all objects should be converted to messages, these objects need to be removed from the file before the simulation is started.

## Parameters
* `file_name` : Location of the ROOT file containing the trees with the object data. The file extension `.root` will be appended if not present.
* `include` : Array of object names (without `allpix::` prefix) to be read from the ROOT trees, all other object names are ignored (cannot be used simultaneously with the *exclude* parameter).
* `exclude`: Array of object names (without `allpix::` prefix) not to be read from the ROOT trees (cannot be used simultaneously with the *include* parameter).
* `ignore_seed_mismatch`: If set to true, a mismatch between the core random seed in the configuration file and the input data is ignored, otherwise an exception is thrown. This also covers the case when the core random seed in the configuration file is missing. Default is set to false.

## Usage
This module should be placed at the beginning of the main configuration. An example to read only PixelCharge and PixelHit objects from the file *data.root* is:

```ini
[ROOTObjectReader]
file_name = "data.root"
include = "PixelCharge", "PixelHit"
```
