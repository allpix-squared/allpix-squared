### Description
Adds an electric field to the detector from one of the supported sources. By default, detectors do not have an electric field applied.

The reader provides the following models for electric fields:

* For **constant** electric fields it add a constant electric field in the z-direction towards the pixel implants. This is not very physical but might aid in developing and testing new charge propagation algorithms.
* For **linear** electric fields, the field has a constant slope determined by the bias voltage and the depletion voltage. The sensor is depleted either from the implant or the back side, the direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the bias voltage (with negative bias voltage the electric field vector points towards the backplane and vice versa).   The sign of depletion voltage is always ignored.
  If the sensor is depleted from the implant side, the absolute value of the electric field is calculated using the formula

    ```math
    E(z) = \frac{|U_{bias}| - |U_{depl}|}{d} + 2 \frac{|U_{depl}|}{d}\left( 1- \frac{z}{d} \right),
    ```
    where d is the thickness of the sensor, and $`U_{depl}`$, $`U_{bias}`$ are the depletion and bias voltages, respectively. In case of a depletion from the back side, the absolute value of the electric field is calculated as
    ```math
    E(z) = \frac{|U_{bias}| - |U_{depl}|}{d} + 2 \frac{|U_{depl}|}{d}\left( \frac{z}{d} \right).
    ```
* For **parabolic** electric fields, a parabola is defined in order to emulate a double-peaked field such as the electric fields observed in sensors after irradiation. The parabola is calculated from the position $`z_{min}`$ and value $`E_{min}`$ of the minimum field in the sensor and the field value at the readout electrode, $`E_{max}`$. The parameters of parabolic equation $`E(z) = az^2 + bz + c`$ then resolve to:
    ```math
    a = \frac{E_{max} - E_{min}}{z_{min}^2 + (d/2)^2 - dz_{min}} \qquad
    b = -2az_{min} \qquad
    c = E_{max} - a ((d/2)^2 - dz_{min}),
    ```
    where $`d`$ is the sensor thickness and $`z`$ the position along the `z`-axis in local coordinates, from $`-d/2`$ to $`+d/2`$. The direction of the electric field is determined by the sign of the field parameters.
* For electric fields from **mesh files** in the *INIT* or *APF* formats it parses a file containing an electric field map in the APF format or the legacy INIT format also used by the PixelAV software [@pixelav]. An example of a electric field in this format can be found in *etc/example_electric_field.init* in the repository. An explanation of the format is available in the source code of this module, a converter tool for electric fields from adaptive TCAD meshes is provided with the framework. Fields of different sizes can be used and mapped onto the pixel matrix using the `field_scale` parameter. By default, the module assumes the field represents a single pixel unit cell. If the field size and pixel pitch do not match, a warning is printed and the field is scaled to the pixel pitch.
* The **custom** field model allows to specify arbitrary analytic field functions for a single or all three vector components of the electric field. For this, the `field_functions` parameter configured with either one formula which is then used for the `z` component of the field vector, or with three functions representing the three components of the field vector. Using the `field_parameters` configuration, values for free parameters defined in the formulae can be set. For the parameters, units are supported and parsed. Each of the field vector components has access to its own free parameters as well as all three coordinates `x`, `y` and `z` which are defined as the position within the respective pixel.


The `depletion_depth` parameter can be used to control the thickness of the depleted region inside the sensor.
This can be useful for devices such as HV-CMOS sensors, where the typical depletion depth but not necessarily the full depletion voltage are know.
It should be noted that `depletion_voltage` and `depletion_depth` are mutually exclusive parameters and only one at a time can be specified.

Furthermore the module can plot the electric field profile on an projection axis normal to the x,y or z-axis at a particular plane in the sensor.
Additional plots comprise the individual field vector components as well as the field magnitude and can be enabled and controlled with the plotting parameter slisted below.

### Parameters
* `model` : Type of the electric field model, either **linear**, **constant**, **parabolic**, **custom** or **mesh**.
* `depletion_depth` : Thickness of the depleted region. Used for all electric fields. When using the depletion depth for the **linear** model, no depletion voltage can be specified.

#### Parameters for models `linear` and `constant`
* `bias_voltage` : Voltage over the whole sensor thickness. Used to calculate the electric field for the models **constant** and **linear**.
* `depletion_voltage` : Indicates the voltage at which the sensor is fully depleted. Used to calculate the electric field if the *model* parameter is equal to **linear**.
* `deplete_from_implants` : Indicates whether the sensor is depleted from the implants or the back side for the **linear** model. Defaults to true (depletion from the implant side).

#### Parameters for model `parabolic`
* `minimum_field` : Value of the electric field in the minimum.
* `minimum_position` : Position of the electric field minimum along `z`, in local coordinates. Required to be located within the sensor volume.
* `maximum_field` : Value of the electric field at the electrode.

#### Parameters for model `mesh`
* `file_name` : Location of file containing the meshed electric field data.
* `field_scale` : Scale of the electric field in x- and y-direction. This parameter allows to use electric fields for fractions or multiple pixels. For example, an electric field calculated for a quarter pixel cell can be used by setting this parameter to `0.5 0.5` (half pitch in both directions) while a field calculated for four pixel cells in y and a single cell in x could be mapped to the pixel grid using `1 4`. Defaults to `1.0 1.0`.
* `field_offset`: Offset of the field from the pixel edge in x- and y-direction. By default, the framework assumes that the provided electric field starts at the edge of the pixel, i.e. with an offset of `0.0`. With this parameter, the field can be shifted e.g. by half a pixel pitch to accommodate for fields which have been simulated starting from the pixel center. In this case, a parameter of `0.5 0.5` should be used. The shift is applied in positive direction of the respective coordinate.

#### Parameters for model `custom`
* `field_functions` : Single equation (for a field vector along the `z` axis only) or array of three equations (for the three components of a vector field). All three coordinates `x`, `y`, and `z` can be used, parameters need to be specified in consecutively numbered square brackets (`[0]`, `[1]`), starting with `[0]` for each of the equations.
* `field_parameters` : Array of values for the parameters of any equation defined in `field_equations`. Units can be used. The number of parameters given must match the sum of the number of free parameters from all defined equations.

### Plotting parameters
* `output_plots` : Determines if output plots should be generated. Disabled by default.
* `output_plots_steps` : Number of bins in both x- and y-direction in the 2D histogram used to plot the electric field in the detectors. Only used if `output_plots` is enabled.
* `output_plots_project` : Axis to project the 3D electric field on to create the 2D histogram. Either **x**, **y** or **z**. Only used if `output_plots` is enabled.
* `output_plots_projection_percentage` : Percentage on the projection axis to plot the electric field profile. For example if *output_plots_project* is **x** and this parameter is set to 0.5, the profile is plotted in the Y,Z-plane at the X-coordinate in the middle of the sensor. Default is 0.5.
* `output_plots_single_pixel`: Determines if the whole sensor has to be plotted or only a single pixel. Defaults to true (plotting a single pixel).

### Usage
An example to add a linear field with a bias voltage of -150 V and a full depletion voltage of -50 V to all the detectors, apart from the detector named 'dut' where a specific meshed field from an INIT file is added, is given below

```ini
[ElectricFieldReader]
model = "linear"
bias_voltage = -150V
depletion_voltage = -50V

[ElectricFieldReader]
name = "dut"
model = "mesh"
# Should point to the example electric field in the repositories etc directory
file_name = "example_electric_field.init"
```

This example uses the parabolic field shape and defines a minimum field and position as well as the field at the electrode:

```ini
[ElectricFieldReader]
model = "parabolic"
# In local coordinates of the sensor, i.e. 100um below the center of the sensor along z:
minimum_position = -100um
minimum_field = 5200V/cm
maximum_field = 10000V/cm
```

An example for a custom field definition is given below. Here, a one-dimensional field is defined, which will be automatically applied to the z-axis of the detector.
Care should be take to use the proper variables in the formula, in this case `z` for the respective coordinate.

```ini
[ElectricFieldReader]
model = "custom"
field_function = "[0]*z*z + [1]"
field_parameters = 12500V/mm/mm/mm, 5000V/cm
```

And finally, a three-dimensional custom field is defined with varying number of parameters per equation and using different coordinates for the three dimensions of the field vector:

```ini
[ElectricFieldReader]
model = "custom"
# Parabolic in x and y, linear in z:
field_function = "[0]*x*y","[0]*x*y","[0]*z + [1]"
field_parameters = 12500V/mm/mm/mm, 12500V/mm/mm/mm, 6000V/cm/cm, 5000V/cm
```
