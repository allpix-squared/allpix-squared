#DESC uses the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integration of the equations of motion implemented in the drift-diffusion model to propagate the charge carriers to the implants under the influence of a constant magnetic field. The monitored output comprises the total number of charges moved, the number of integration steps taken and the simulated propagation time.
