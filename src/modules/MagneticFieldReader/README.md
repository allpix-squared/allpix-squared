## Description
Unique module, adds a magnetic field to the full volume, including the active sensors. By default, the magnetic field is turned off.

The magnetic field reader only provides constant magnetic fields, read in as a three-dimensional vector. The magnetic field is forwarded to the GeometryManager, enabling the magnetic field for the particle propagation via Geant4, as well as to all detectors for enabling a Lorentz drift during the charge propagation.

## Parameters
* `model` : Type of the magnetic field model, currently only **constant** possible.
* `magnetic_field` : Vector describing the magnetic field.

## Usage
An example is given below

```ini
[MagneticFieldReader]
model = "constant"
magnetic_field = 500mT 3.8T 0T
```
